1. Light a candle: The flame is often seen as a way to guide spirits or show that you remember them.

When considering what to offer to a vampire guest in a fictional or fantastical context—assuming you're engaging with the traditional lore of vampires—there are some thematic offerings that might be considered appropriate.

1. **Synthetic Blood**: If you're going with modern vampire interpretations where synthetic blood is an acceptable alternative for real blood, offering a "blood substitute" could be a fun and quirky option.
